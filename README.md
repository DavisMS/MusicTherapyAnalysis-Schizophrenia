<h1>Music Therapy Analysis - Schizophrenia</h1>

<h2>Description</h2>
This project (Repl) is an analysis of the effects of music therapy treatment for individuals with Schizophrenia. Gathering data on the subject, I hope to understand better how beneficial or detrimental music therapy can be as a form of treatment. With this research, I hope to answer its effectiveness with different age groups and genders plus compare overall positive versus negative results. Researchers did not indicate having participants pay, or to be paid to participate in the studies, so music therapy costs have been excluded from this analysis.

<h2>Results</h2>
Based on the results I received, I think Music therapy is beneficial in improving negative symptoms and behavioral issues among individuals with Schizophrenia. I gathered data on 2,527 participants, with 1,400 men and 739 women (figure1) aged between 15 and 65 (age_comparisons_4) and discovered a 78.83% improvement rate for participants who completed their trials (Figure_Results_2 and Completion_Status_3) through analysis via code. Indicating that Music therapy, both as an adjunct and main therapy form, is beneficial for both men and women ranging from mid-teens to mid-sixties. However, it should be noted that despite the 78.83% improvement rate, there were individuals who did not complete the treatment for various reasons, such as hospital discharge and a lack of wanting to continue treatment. With that in mind, there is not much room for negative results (adverse reactions or worsening behaviors) from music therapy since researchers could not follow up with these individuals. Otherwise, I still think the overall results are positive for most participants.
